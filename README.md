## 🧩 Project Architecture — Atomic Design

This project follows the Atomic File Structure, organizing UI into:

- **Atoms** – Small, reusable components (buttons, text, images)
- **Molecules** – Composed elements such as search bars or card layouts
- **Organisms** – Complex UI structures (anime lists, headers)
- **Pages** – Full screens rendered via routing

Why Atomic Design?

- Reduces duplicated UI
- Makes components cleaner and easier to maintain
- Scales well as the app grows
